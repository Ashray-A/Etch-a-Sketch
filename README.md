# Etch-a-Sketch Project

This is a simple web-based Etch-a-Sketch application where users can create drawings on a grid of squares.

## Features

- Create a grid with a specified number of squares per side.
- Hover over squares to draw on the grid.
- Reset the grid with a new size.
- Bonus: Each interaction randomizes the squareâ€™s RGB value and adds a progressive darkening effect.

## Demo

2. Hover over the squares to draw.
3. Enjoy the bonus features for a unique drawing experience!

- Randomized Colors: Each interaction randomizes the color of the square.
- Progressive Darkening: Each interaction darkens the color by 10%, eventually reaching black after ten interactions.
